"""
Shared Utilities Module (Future Implementation)

This module is reserved for shared utility functions that may be needed across
both client and server components.

Potential Future Utilities:
- Configuration management (loading from config files)
- Logging utilities (structured logging, log formatting)
- Data validation helpers
- Common mathematical operations
- File I/O helpers for model loading/saving
- Network utility functions
- Performance profiling decorators

Currently, project-specific utilities are kept in their respective modules
to maintain clear separation of concerns.
